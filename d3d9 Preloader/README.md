# d3d9.dll Preloader  

Simple d3d9.dll wrapper used by DS-ExeModifier to load d3d9.dll from the system directory instead of the local directory to circumvent any existing d3d9.dll wrappers that may cause incompatibility issues (such as PvP Watchdog). This wrapper does not modify or add to the functionality of the original d3d9.dll.
