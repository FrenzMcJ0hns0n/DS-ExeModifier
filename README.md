# DS-ExeModifier
A GUI program to modify the Dark Souls game executable.

The aim of this program is to offer an easier way to modify DARKSOULS.exe than using an hex editor, in order to load mods. It was greatly inspired by Wulf's work. See the repository DS-ModPrep :
https://github.com/Wulf2k

### Why would you want to modify DARKSOULS.exe ?  
To load mods relative to sounds, maps, etc ... from folders you can interact with.
Use Wulf's BND Rebuilder to extract dvdbnd[0-1-2-3] archives and get these folders.
