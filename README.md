# DS-ExeModifier
A GUI program to modify the Dark Souls game executable easily.

The aim of this program is to offer an easier way to modify DARKSOULS.exe, with a simple GUI, instead of using an hex editor. It was greatly inspired by Wulf's work. See the repository DS-ModPrep :
https://github.com/Wulf2k

Why would you want to modify DARKSOULS.exe ?  
To load mods relative to sounds, maps, etc ... from folders you can easily alter.

Use Wulf's BND Rebuilder to extract dvdbnd[0-1-2-3] archives and get these folders.
