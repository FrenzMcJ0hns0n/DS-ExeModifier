# DS-ExeModifier
A GUI program to modify the Dark Souls game executable (DARKSOULS.exe) easily

The aim of this program is to offer an easier way to modify DARKSOULS.exe, with a simple and intuitive GUI, insteaf of using an hex editor. It was greatly inspired by Wulf's work. See the repository DS-ModPrep :

Why would you want to modify DARKSOULS.exe ?  
To load mods relative to sounds, maps, etc ... from extracted folders you can easily alter, thanks to Wulf's BND Rebuilder.
